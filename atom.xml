    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We were having some problems getting subdomains created.  We had to request the subdomain and then that request was put into a ticket and sent to the external vendor that would create the actual subdomain.  The process took weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A creative individual had a few domains that he wasn&amp;#8217;t using, so he decided to start creating subdomains for the team.  He offered almost instantaneous turnaround time.  Everyone loved the new process and didn&amp;#8217;t mind that the domain being used wasn&amp;#8217;t necessarily blessed as official.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only person that didn&amp;#8217;t love this process was Slow Joe.  He was the person whose job was to create the subdomains.  He felt cut out of the loop and pushed to the sideline.  Joe didn&amp;#8217;t like this process and thought that things should be much more official.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Joe had a point, he hadn&amp;#8217;t shown any ability to accomplish his tasks in a timeline manner in the past.  The team became much more efficient by simply cutting him out of the loop.  To take that ability away from the team and give it back to Joe would send a message that process mattered more than efficiency.  Even worse, it would show the team that creative solutions weren&amp;#8217;t encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would you do?&lt;/p&gt;
